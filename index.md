### Introduction

Mental issue has been a big topic in the recent years and has burst even more after the recent covid pandemic with the closing of borders, lockdown situation and what not.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Mr-Ahmad-Khalil/Twitter_Classification/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
